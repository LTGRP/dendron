Requirements:
 - docutils (for converting RST to HTML)
 - Jinja2 (for templating)

To generate the complete specification along with supporting documentation, run:
    python gendoc.py

The output of this will be inside the "gen" folder.

Matrix.org only ("gen" folder has matrix.org tweaked pages):
    ./matrix-org-gendoc.sh /path/to/matrix.org/includes/nav.html
